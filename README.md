#Polynomial Calculator

The main objective of this project is to design and implement a polynomial calculator with a dedicated graphical interface through which the user 
can insert polynomials, select the mathematical operation (i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, 
derivative, integration) to be performed and view the result. Consider the polynomials of one variable and
integer coefficients.

The user introduces one or two polynomials (depending on the operation) in the text fields in the form:
    an x^n +an-1 x^n-1 + … + a1 x + a0 or
    an X^n +an-1 X^n-1 + … + a1 X + a0 
(the input strings can have any space, anywhere, for readability purposes).

Then, he/she chooses the operation to be performed by pressing the corresponding button and sees the result appear in the „Result‟ text field.
For the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations, both text fields have to contain the polynomials and for the derivative and integration operations, 
only the first text field (First polynomial) is considered.
